Pre processed surfaces must be called upper and lower and saved in .npy format and placed in directory /aperture_generation/Pre_processed_data. 
Aperture generation code, key input parameters for executing number swapping algorithm and generating apertures can be altered in input_variables.py
run_ap_gen executes all the required codes, can turn some key methods to false if number swapping or calculating Hurst has already been run.
generated apertures and surfaces found in /aperture_generation/generate_surfs_and_aps/.
